# System Design
## Scalability
Scalability refers to the ability of a system, process, or organization to handle an increasing amount of work or growth without experiencing a decline in performance or quality. In other words, a scalable system is one that can accommodate a growing workload or user base without requiring significant changes to its underlying architecture or infrastructure.

Scalability is important because as businesses grow, their demand for resources and capacity increases. A scalable system is one that can adapt to these changes without becoming overwhelmed or causing delays, downtime, or other performance problems.

There are different types of scalability, including:

1. Vertical scalability: This refers to the ability of a system to handle an increased workload by adding more resources to a single machine or server, such as increasing the amount of RAM or CPU power.

2. Horizontal scalability: This refers to the ability of a system to handle an increased workload by adding more machines or servers to a distributed network, such as adding more nodes to a cluster.

3. Elastic scalability: This refers to the ability of a system to automatically adjust its resources based on changes in demand, such as increasing or decreasing the number of servers in response to fluctuating traffic.

Achieving scalability can involve various strategies, such as designing software for distributed architectures, using load balancers, optimizing database performance, and using caching techniques.
